## Insights and Findings
These are the insights and findings from the e-commerce analytics:
- Most of the transactions happened from 10 AM till midnight
- November is the month with highest transactions
- High review scores of sellers/products do not translate to higher sales with correlation score < 0.01. Despite low correlation score, there are more sales happening on products with review score between 3.5-4.5
- Top payment methods are credit_card follows by boreto
- These are the top 10 products category with highest sales on the platform: bed_bath_table, furniture_decor, sorts_leisure, health_beauty, computers_accessories, housewares, toys, garden_tools, cool_stuff and watches_gifts
- bed_bath_table has the highest sales but it is not the highest AOV which means customers purchased more bed_bath_table items but does not spend more money on these items. Instead, customers spend more money on computer_accessories
- Top 3 sales are made from customers from these cities: sao paulo, rio de janeiro, and belo horizonte. Similarly, top 3 sales are made from these states: SP, RJ and MG. Merchants would want to target these cities or states to boost overall sales as majority customers live here
- There is 0 customer retention in 2017
- More sellers become more active on Olist and more sales happening when there are more sellers

## Product Design and Recommendation
There are the recommendations that Olist can take to improve overall sales:
- Merchants need to do flash sales after 10 AM for effective marketing as most transactions happen after 10 AM till midnight
- Merchants should allow customers to make payments by these two methods namely credit_card and boreto to stay competitive in the market
- Merchants should aim to get ratings between 3.5-4.5 as most sales happen to product/seller with this review score. Olist should incentivise customers to give review score on the platform
- Olist should create a loyalty programme to improve its customer retention rate
- 42% customers stay at sao paolo contributes follows by 22% customers stay at rio de janeiro. Olist should prioritise these cities in their sales strategy like sales, better shipping, etc.
- The higest profitable items (high AOV) are not the top sales items on Olist. Olist should consider promoting these high AOV product_category more on the platform to improve overall revenue
